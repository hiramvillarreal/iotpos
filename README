LemonPOS is an open source Point of Sale software targeted for micro, small and medium businesses.
MySQL is employed for data management and storage, and can be used a single database with
many POS terminals on a network.
Being Linux or any other unix the target operating system, your information is safer against
virus attacks, and lowers the costs in licenses.

an administration tool for managing your store, printed reports, and more...

It has beeen tested with a parallel matrix printer (Star Micronics SP500), an USB thermal printer
